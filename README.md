# Regex Tutorial: Comprehensive Guide to Regular Expressions

## Overview

The Regex Tutorial project is designed to provide a detailed and comprehensive guide to regular expressions (regex). Regular expressions are powerful tools used in programming for pattern matching and data validation. This tutorial aims to educate developers on how to use regex effectively, explaining different components and providing practical examples.

## Features

- **Detailed Explanations**: Learn about different regex components, including literals, metacharacters, character classes, and more.
- **Examples and Use Cases**: Explore various use cases with examples that demonstrate how to implement regex in real-world scenarios.
- **Interactive Demos**: Experiment with regex patterns through interactive demos that allow users to test and modify regex code.
- **Resource Links**: Access additional resources and documentation to further deepen your understanding of regex.

## Technologies Used

- **Markdown**: For writing the tutorial content in a structured and readable format.
- **HTML/CSS**: For styling the tutorial webpage and enhancing readability.
- **JavaScript**: To create interactive demos and allow users to experiment with regex patterns.
- **Node.js**: Backend processing to handle user inputs and manage the interactive components.
